# Packing Table Schema Changes

## Overview
The packing table primary key has been changed from `(week_commencing, fg_code)` to `(week_commencing, packing_date, product_code, machinery)`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Changes (models/packing.py)
- ✅ Updated primary key fields in the Packing model
- ✅ Added `machinery` as part of the primary key
- ✅ Updated foreign key constraint (if needed)

### 2. Controller Changes (controllers/packing_controller.py)
- ✅ Updated `update_packing_entry()` function to use new primary key structure
- ✅ Updated `packing_create()` to check for existing records with new key structure
- ✅ Added fallback logic to handle existing records with old structure

### 3. Database Schema Changes
- ❌ **NEEDS MANUAL EXECUTION**: Run the SQL script `fix_packing_schema.sql` to update the database

## Required Actions

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Run the SQL script** to fix the database schema:
   ```sql
   -- Execute these commands in your MySQL database:
   ALTER TABLE packing DROP INDEX uq_packing_week_product;
   ALTER TABLE packing DROP PRIMARY KEY;
   ALTER TABLE packing ADD PRIMARY KEY (week_commencing, packing_date, product_code, machinery);
   ```

### Testing Required:
1. Test creating new packing entries
2. Test editing existing packing entries
3. Test bulk operations
4. Test search and filtering functionality

## Error Handling
The code now includes:
- Check for existing records before creating new ones
- Fallback logic to handle records with old structure
- Proper error messages for duplicate key violations

## Notes
- The `id` field is still available as an auto-increment field for internal references
- All existing functionality should continue to work after the database schema is updated
- The foreign key constraint to the SOH table remains unchanged
