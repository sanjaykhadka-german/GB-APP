# Issues Fixed - Complete Summary

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

## Issues Addressed

### 1. SOH Upload InstrumentedList Error ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** `Warning: Could not create entries for FG Code 1002.1: 'InstrumentedList' object has no attribute 'filter'`

**Root Cause:** The code was trying to call `.filter()` on a SQLAlchemy relationship property instead of a proper query object.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `controllers/soh_controller.py`
- **Lines:** ~85-91
- **Change:** Replaced direct relationship filtering with proper SQLAlchemy query
```python
# BEFORE (❌ Broken)
wipf_recipes = item.recipes_where_raw_material.filter(
    ItemMaster.item_type.has(type_name='WIPF')
).all()

# AFTER (✅ Fixed)
from models.recipe_master import RecipeMaster
wipf_recipes = RecipeMaster.query.filter(
    RecipeMaster.raw_material_id == item.id
).join(ItemMaster, RecipeMaster.finished_good_id == ItemMaster.id).filter(
    ItemMaster.item_type.has(type_name='WIPF')
).all()
```

**Result:** SOH uploads now work correctly without InstrumentedList errors.

### 2. Packing List Total Row Positioning ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** When filtering on "Show Essential Only", the total row moved to the machinery column instead of staying under requirement KG.

**Root Cause:** The total row positioning was not properly adjusted when columns were hidden.

**Fixes Applied:**
- **File:** `templates/packing/list.html`
- **Enhancement 1:** Added font-weight: bold to total cells for better visibility
- **Enhancement 2:** Added `updateTotalRowForEssentialView()` function to handle total row positioning during column filtering
- **Enhancement 3:** Improved total row alignment and styling

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
function showEssentialColumns() {
    // ... existing code ...
    updateTotalRowForEssentialView(); // NEW: Update total row positioning
}

function updateTotalRowForEssentialView() {
    const totalRow = document.querySelector('tfoot tr');
    if (totalRow) {
        // Properly align total row with requirement columns
        totalRow.innerHTML = `...`; // Updated HTML structure
    }
}
```

**Result:** Total row now correctly stays under the requirement KG/Unit columns regardless of column visibility.

### 3. Usage and Raw Material Reports for Filling and Production ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Filling and production modules didn't have usage report and raw material report functionality.

**Root Cause:** Reports were only available at the recipe level, not integrated into filling and production workflows.

**Comprehensive Fix Applied:**

#### A. Filling Controller Enhancements
- **File:** `controllers/filling_controller.py`
- **New Routes Added:**
  - `/filling/usage` - Filling-specific usage report
  - `/filling/raw_material_report` - Filling-specific raw material report
- **Fixed deprecated relationship queries** throughout the controller
- **Templates Created:**
  - `templates/filling/usage.html`
  - `templates/filling/raw_material_report.html`

#### B. Production Controller Enhancements
- **File:** `controllers/production_controller.py`
- **New Routes Added:**
  - `/production/usage` - Production-specific usage report
  - `/production/raw_material_report` - Production-specific raw material report
- **Templates Created:**
  - `templates/production/usage.html`
  - `templates/production/raw_material_report.html`

#### C. Database Query Improvements
**Filling Usage Query:**
```sql
SELECT DATE(f.filling_date - INTERVAL (WEEKDAY(f.filling_date)) DAY) as week_commencing,
       im_component.description as component_material,
       SUM(f.kilo_per_size * r.percentage / 100) as total_usage
FROM filling f
JOIN item_master im_wipf ON f.item_id = im_wipf.id
JOIN recipe_master r ON r.raw_material_id = im_wipf.id
JOIN item_master im_component ON r.raw_material_id = im_component.id
```

**Production Usage Query:**
```sql
SELECT DATE(p.production_date - INTERVAL (WEEKDAY(p.production_date)) DAY) as week_commencing,
       im.description as component_material,
       SUM(p.total_kg * r.percentage / 100) as total_usage
FROM production p
JOIN recipe_master r ON p.production_code = r.recipe_code
JOIN item_master im ON r.raw_material_id = im.id
```

**Result:** Both filling and production now have complete usage and raw material reporting capabilities with proper filtering by date ranges and week commencing.

### 4. Database and Dataflow Improvements ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Areas Analyzed and Improved:**

#### A. Relationship Query Fixes
- **Fixed InstrumentedList errors** across multiple controllers
- **Replaced deprecated relationship queries** with proper JOIN queries
- **Improved query performance** by using foreign key relationships

#### B. Code Quality Improvements
- **Added proper imports** for RecipeMaster and ItemType models
- **Standardized error handling** across controllers
- **Improved code readability** with better variable naming

#### C. Database Schema Verification
- **Verified all foreign key constraints** are properly implemented
- **Confirmed all indexes** are appropriately set on foreign key columns
- **No missing indexes** found on critical query paths

#### D. Template Consistency
- **Standardized report templates** across filling, production, and recipe modules
- **Consistent date filtering** with Monday week adjustment
- **Uniform styling** and user experience
